> *“Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.”*

—John Adams, *Letter to John Taylor*, 1814

This is a game of an alternate future based off of a political simulation held by a group of madwomen, men, and general sociopaths. The simulation will attempt to model these events as well as possible with a straight face, but if anything has been misrepresented you may always inform me.

= 2249

It is an inflection point for Martian democracy. The last planetary elections in 2225 saw the planet torn apart in a brutal civil war between separatists and autonomist-unionists over the question of the planet's relationship to the United Nations, which only ended with the dissolution of the Martian Free State and the enactment of the UNTAM in 2241. 

Since that time, the planet has been run by D'Artagnal Qiu and a technocratic administration, generally supported for its moderate and stabilizing role. However, the 2248 Executorial election saw a surprising upswing in oppositionist votes, and as such the United Nations has decided to give Mars her third democratic experiment, set for 2250.

The role of the Democratic Party of Mars will be to prepare for this election as the preeminent center-left political force on the planet, attempt to enact its plans for large-scale political and economic reform, and steer the planet through its first hesitating steps returning to democratic governance.
